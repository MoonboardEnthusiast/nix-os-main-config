**This repo is supposed to used as config by NvChad users!**

- The main nvchad repo (NvChad/NvChad) is used as a plugin by this repo.
- So you just import its modules , like `require "nvchad.options" , require "nvchad.mappings"`
- So you can delete the .git from this repo ( when you clone it locally ) or fork it :)

# Credits

1) Lazyvim starter https://github.com/LazyVim/starter as nvchad's starter was inspired by Lazyvim's . It made a lot of things easier!
# Notes
This is used as the baseline to make modifications on, might switch to a more hybrid approach where the Neovim config is completely separate from the nixos repo.
