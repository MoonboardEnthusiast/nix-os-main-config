# Nixos-Config
This is my nixos config using flakes and home-manager.

What I actually wanted to set up is:
- Bazel
- C and C++ support
- Cuda
- WSL2
- NixOs

This config has all of these and I managed to effectively build and run cuda binaries with this config.

Future iterations will add a more personalized touch, as I am currentl still getting familiar with NixOs.

Wanting to add new profiles for homelab and others.
